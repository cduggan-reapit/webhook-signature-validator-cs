      # There's a few commands in a row here, let's explain them:
      # Create a self-contained exe - this will be quite big as it includes the runtime
      # Move that file from Signature.exe to Signature.bundle.exe
      # Create the exe without the embedded runtime, which will be a lot smaller (~10x)
      # Copy the readme into the 'publish' directory
      # Navigate to that directory & zip up it's contents (ignoring the .pdb file)
